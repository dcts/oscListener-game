Contains a collection of processing scetches that can be connected with TouchOSC and controlled by a smartphone. 
- **game**: in the making. Current state: OSC controller connected.
- **visualizations**: working prototype for a swarm visualizer that can be controlled with OSC. Inspired by [Cyrill Studer's swarm synthesizer](https://cyrillstuder.ch/swarm-synthesizer)!
